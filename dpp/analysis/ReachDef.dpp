// TODO: So it seems we need some handle on Store, e.g. an id field or location
// This is also required for kcfa... But, if we add a unique id, then we lose the need for relations
// Instead we end up with partial maps.
// Store : Location -> Var -> Field -> Var
// PointsTo: Object x Field -> Power(Object).
// so PointsTo(o1, f, o2) actually means exists o1, f s.t. {o2} <= PointsTo(o1, f).
// But what if we want to match on the Power itself, instead of one of its elements?
