# Termination Analysis
A common programming mistake is to write an unintentional infinite loop. 
Most contemporary programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, Scala, etc. do not help programmers avoid such issues.
Termination analysis or termination checkers describe a wide-range of techniques that can be used to verify that a program 
(or part of a program) always terminates, for any input. These techniques range from sophisticated type systems to the use of
SMT solvers. In the case of functional programming, such termination checkers may try to ensure termination by verifying that recursion is always on structurally smaller elements. 

The aim of this project is to explore the design space of termination analysis for a functional language.
The work will include reading papers, language design, and implementation in a real-world programming language.

# Type-Safe Compilation
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the most popular, widely-used run-time environment and JIT-compiler on the planet.
Numerous languages, including Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, etc., compile to JVM bytecode and run on the JVM.
However, the JVM bytecode format is intricate and compiling to JVM bytecode is error-prone. 
For example, the JVM is stack-based machine, and so to perform e.g. addition we push two integers on the stack,
and perform the IADD instruction which pops both operands and pushes the sum. However, it is easy to mistakenly 
generate JVM bytecode such that say the stack contains only one integer before the IADD instruction, leading to crashes at run-time.
What we would like is a library / embedded DSL that ensures that the JVM bytecode generated by a compiler satisfies
(some of) the properties of the JVM bytecode language.

The aim of this project is to explore the design of a library for type-safe code generation of JVM bytecode.
The work will include reading papers, language design, and implementation in a real-world programming language.
